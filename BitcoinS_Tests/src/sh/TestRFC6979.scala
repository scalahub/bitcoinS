Pride comes before a fall.
The proof of the pudding is in the eating. (Nowadays mysteriously shortened to "the proof is in the pudding")
Put up or shut up.
Put your money where your mouth is.
The road to hell is paved with good intentions.
A rolling stone gathers no moss.
Rome wasn't built in a day.
Rules were meant to be broken.
Scratch my back and I'll scratch yours.
Seeing is believing.
The show must go on.
Silence is golden.
Slow and steady wins the race.
Spare the rod, spoil the child.
Speak softly and carry a big stick.
The squeaky wheel gets the grease.
Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words (sometimes 'names') will never hurt me.  
Still waters run deep.
A stitch in time saves nine.
Strike while the iron is hot
Talk is cheap.
There's a sucker born every minute.
There's more than one way to skin a cat.
There is no accounting for tastes.
There's no fool like an old fool.
There is no honor among thieves.
There's no place like home.
There's no time like the present.
They don't make things like they used to.
Time heals all wounds.
To err is human, to forgive, divine.
Too many cooks spoil the broth.
Truth is stranger than fiction.
Turnabout is fair play.
Two heads are better than one.
Two's company, three's a crowd.
Two wrongs don't make a right.
Up a creek without a paddle.
Waste not, want not.
A watched pot never boils.
The way to a man's heart is through his stomach.
Well begun is half done.
What goes around comes around.
Whatever will be, will be.
What you see is what you get.
When it rains, it pours.
When in Rome, (do as the Romans do.)
When the cat's away the mice will play.
When one door closes another door opens.
When the going gets tough, the tough get going.
Where there's a will, there's a way.
Where there's smoke, there's fire.
A woman's work is never done.
You can't have your cake and eat it too.
You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him drink.
You can't please everyone.
You can't take it with you.
You can't teach an old dog new tricks.
You get what you pay for.
You can't win them all.
You have to break a few eggs to make an omlette.
You have to take the good  with the bad.
You win some, you lose some.""".lines.map(_.trim).toArray
